Legacy enterprise systems continue to underpin critical business operations,
yet their documentation is often outdated or nonexistent. This creates
significant challenges for maintenance, modernization, and compliance.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to
automate aspects of requirements discovery. In this work, we explore a hybrid
pipeline that combines deterministic program analysis with LLM-based reasoning
to extract business requirements from legacy codebases.

Recent research highlights the growing role of large language models in
requirements engineering \cite{hemmat2025research}.
